Used GitHub Copilot for My Project

Build a full-stack MVP for a modern e-commerce website called ShopEase using React.js, Node.js (Express), and MongoDB.
The app should have Home, Product Listing, Product Details, Cart, Login, Register, and Profile pages.
Use React Router v6 for navigation and Context API for cart management.
Implement JWT authentication with persistent login using localStorage and protect Cart and Profile routes.
The backend should have modular routing and CRUD operations for users, products, and carts.
Use Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive UI.

Set up the Express.js backend with MongoDB connection, dotenv for environment variables, and CORS..

Define User, Product, and Cart models using Mongoose.
Add password hashing with bcrypt for users and timestamps for all models.

Create seed.js with 12 diverse products across categories:
- Electronics (iPhone, Samsung, MacBook, Sony Headphones, Kindle)
- Clothing (Levi's Jeans)
- Sports (Nike Air Max)
- Home & Kitchen (Instant Pot, Dyson Vacuum)
- Books, Toys, Beauty products
- Include realistic prices, brands, ratings, stock, images

Build authentication routes for register and login using JWT.
Add middleware to protect routes and verify tokens.

Develop product routes for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching products.
Support filtering by category and sorting by price.

Create cart routes that let users add, update, and remove items.
Each cart should be linked to a specific user and return total quantity and price.

Build frontend pages using React and Tailwind CSS — Home, Products, Product Details, Cart, Login, Register, and Profile.
Use React Router v6 for navigation and Context API for managing cart and authentication state.

Connect the frontend to the backend using Axios.
Handle login/register, product listing, and cart actions through REST API calls.

Make the design responsive with Tailwind CSS and ensure smooth navigation and real-time cart updates
