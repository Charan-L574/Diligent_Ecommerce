# AI PROMPTS USED FOR SHOPEASE E-COMMERCE PROJECT

================================================================================
1. INITIAL PROJECT SETUP
================================================================================

Build a full-stack MVP for a modern e-commerce website called "ShopEase" using React.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. 

The frontend should be responsive and feature:
- Home, Product Listing, Product Details, Cart, Login, Register, and Profile pages.
- Use React Router v6 for navigation and Context API for cart management.
- Implement JWT-based authentication with persistent login using localStorage.
- Include protected routes for Cart and Profile pages.
- Display dynamic cart count and total price.

The backend should:
- Use Node.js + Express with modular routing (authRoutes, productRoutes, cartRoutes).
- Include controllers and models for Users, Products, and Cart.
- Use MongoDB Compass with Mongoose schemas.
- Implement JWT auth, bcrypt password hashing, and CRUD operations for products and carts.

Ensure modern UI/UX design with Tailwind or Material UI, and mimic real e-commerce flow (like Amazon/Flipkart).
Structure the project in a modular, scalable way with separate frontend and backend folders.
